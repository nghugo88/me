In Lecture today, we briefly discussed about the importance of programming and its functionality in shaping our everyday lives. Moving onto the lecture, we  learnt How to print a message and display it onto the Mac Terminal through Python by using the variable "Print("Enter Text!").

_Important Notes_  
- Always remember to enter a ! at the ned
- For Mac, to use Python commands to run tests, you must go to Mac Terminal to do it. 
- You can't use any or contain any CAPITAL letters in the code otherwise it won't work properly.
- In order to complete the work for marking, must submit on Github. [Can be done by pushing]
- To run the tests to check progress, -> Go To Mac Terminal and do Python ../course/Week#/Tests.py
