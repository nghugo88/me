TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Lecture Notes:
- Shallow indentation is a good use to simplify the code which can be done by the functions and also through different expressions.
- Simplifying Code will make it easier to read and to understand in future reference

#Exercise #1

Countdown
A Complicated / Messy code can be simplified within the excercise by just using a countdown rather than using 10 prints. This is much more convenient

For the Triangle exercises
                            
        To make it work, made a new variables and did a simple maths function in order to find the area / Perimeter / Aspect 
        Used ** for base raised to the power of 2
        Used * for representing Times
        Used {} to modify inside variables
        
        Formula
        Hypotenuse = (Base^2 + Height^2)^2 Divided by 1/2
        Area = Base x Height / 2
        Perimeter [Had to Google this for the formula] = ((Base x Base) + (Height x Height)) ^1/2 + Base + Height
        Aspect was the most difficult one which i had to ask my friends for help as i had no clue in how to do it at all :(
            Update: I finally understand now and how it works is with a If / elif / else function which would ultimately calculate it

        Overall it was basically a maths function with the mix up of Python



Triangle Master 
 - Not much to do except to simplify the code itself with if / elif and else functions which i really found out that it cuts the code by almost half and makes it MUCH more easier to read.

Wordy Pyramid
 - I attempted to do it but i do not understand and i am still stuck...

Get a word and List_Of_Words
    For this part of the exercise, it took me more than 3 hours to complete and fully understand. Part of this was due to me being forgetting to update the exercises which lead to me being stuck with the old tests which i could not debug properly. However, these 2 parts basically is like importing JSon like in week 4 which takes time to understand. 

    For the Get a word
    1. Import request
    2. Put the URL in which is from the US-Central
    3. Make the statement of If type(length)
    4. Link formating
    5. Request to get the link
    6. Make a request status code 
    7. Name anything as the content and make it as a "STRING" 
    8. Do [2:len(message)-1] which acquires the words from the url and name it with anything
    9. Return and finished.

    List_Of_Words
    1. Import request
    2. Put the URL in which is from the US-Central
    3. Make a list
    4. Link formating
    5. Request to get the link
    6. Make a request status code 
    7. Create the message like last one but no need to make a string
    8. Do list append
    9. Return the list and finished.

#Exercise #2

Square Koch
 - The Square Koch was very simple after reading the example provided. As every turn of the Square is 90 Degree, so all i had to do was change the values to 90 degrees as well as changing the koch name to square_koch and it's done.



#Important Notes
 1. Status Code always set it as 200 
 2. == Means Is
 3. ** Means ^2
 4. * Means x
