TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Lecture Notes:
- Be Ethical on Data usage 
- Simplifying Code will make it easier to read and to understand in future reference
                                    ->  Countdown <-
A Complicated / Messy code can be simplified within the excercise by just using a countdown rather than using 10 prints. This is much more convenient
                                    -> Triangles Excercise Notes <-
To make it work, made a new variables and did a simple maths function in order to find the area / Perimeter / Aspect 
Used ** for base raised to the power of 2
Used * for representing Times
Used {} to modify inside variables
