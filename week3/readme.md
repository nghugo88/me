__Exercise #1__

Exercise 1 was fairly similar to last week's exercise 3 which required looping and list + append creation. So the first few was not that hard to do with the help of Googling on the internet which helped me solve alot of the issues i've had.
        
        a += b Means that a = a + b 
        Increasing the step size can be done by doing a+=2 instead of a+=b
        The Variable "Step" can be replaced with integers


The Expression == can mean "Is" EG -> If moves is true [ If Moves == True ]

For Stubborn Asker and the rest of the 2 things, after watching Ben's videos as well as googling for solutions. i eventually worked out how they function and their meanings however still struggling a little bit on fully writing it by myself. 





__Exercise #2__

Exercise 2 was basically a guessing game that was similar to Exercise #1 but more prolonged within the code itself. It was a great example to prepare myself for the upcoming 2 exercises which required much more effort.




__Exercise #3__

Exercise 3 was one heck of a long experience. I had to use the things i've done in exercise 1 and apply it towards exercise 3. I found out that the stubborn asker and rejecter were very useful in solving this solution. I haven't done exercise 3 until week 5 as i didn't initally understand the concept of it due to me not passing the number rejecter test. [I found out the issue and rewrote the code and it works now :D]

Overall, exercise 3 involved alot of if/else function as well as other similar compononent.




__Exercise #4__

The Binary search in Exercise 4 was fairly straightforward after week 1,2,3 redo's of the exercises as i have begun to understand into the more advanced concept of coding within Python. In order to complete exercise 4, i've searched on google as well as using learnt things from the lab. 

I've done Ex 4 with a function of int(l + ((h - l)/2)) followed by a if + else function then a += function which worked at the end of the day. 



__Important Notes__
 1. Make sure there are no spacing in a+=b functions
 2. The While Functions involves alot of If/Else Function ], need to make sure the > and < are correct otherwise it will not work properly.
 3. Len() counts the number of index length EG: len(52,21,92) / len(search_list)
 4. != means "Not Equal To" and can be used for varies of functions [Also works as a logical comparison]
