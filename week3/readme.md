-------------------------------------Exercise #1-----------------------------------------------

Exercise 1 was fairly similar to last week's exercise 3 which required looping and list + append creation. So the first few was not that hard to do with the help of Googling on the internet which helped me solve alot of the issues i've had.
        
        a += b Means that a = a + b 
        Increasing the step size can be done by doing a+=2 instead of a+=b
        The Variable "Step" can be replaced with integers


The Expression == can mean "Is" EG -> If moves is true [ If Moves == True ]

-------------------------------------Exercise #2-----------------------------------------------

Exercise 2 was basically a guessing game that was similar to Exercise #1 but more prolonged within the code itself. It was a great example to prepare myself for the upcoming 2 exercises which required much more effort.


-------------------------------------Exercise #3-----------------------------------------------

Exercise 3 was one heck of a long copy and paste experience. I had to use the things i've done in exercise 1 and apply it towards exercise 3. I found out that the stubborn asker and rejecter were very useful in solving this solution. I haven't done exercise 3 until week 5 as i didn't initally understand the concept of it due to me not passing the number rejecter test. [I found out the issue and rewrote the code and it works now :D]

Overall, exercise 3 involved alot of if/else function as well as other similar compononent.


-------------------------------------Exercise #4-----------------------------------------------

Exercise 4 was fairly simple after week 1,2,3 redo's of the exercises as i have begun to understand into the more advanced concept of coding within Python. In order to complete exercise 4, i've searched on google as well as using learnt things from the lab. 

I have completed Ex 4 with a Mathematic function of int(l + ((h - l)/2)) followed by a if + else function then a += function which worked at the end of the day. 

Important Notes
 1. Make sure there are no spacing in a+=b functions
