TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
"in" is important in python
#for loops
my_list = [1,2,3,4]
for value in my_list:
    print(value)
#range 
for idx in range(5):
    print(idx)


for idx in range(len(my_list_))
    print(my_list[idx])
# Len()

#while loops
idx = 0
while idx < len(my_list):
    print(my_list[idx])
    idx = idx + 1

To create a loop without a range
   t =[]
    while start<stop:
        t.append(start)
        start+=step 
    return None 
    If theres no (step) variable then add a number which will define the step -> such as '2'

    I've also learned that this is so damn hard 
        while True:
        t = input("enter a number between {} and {}".format(low,high))
        t = int(t)
        if t < high and t > low:
            return t
    for a while loop of true and false
