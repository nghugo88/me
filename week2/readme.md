the_answer = a_number + 1 For any number + 1 = to a answer remember to put "return the_answer"
a_number + another_number for multiple number adding
a_string.upper() means making a word upper caps
a_string.upper() + ' ' + str(a_number) 
 + ' ' is a space
 'a_number' and a_number is different 
 str(a_number) turns into string number
 Always remember to add a : at end of code
 Looping is mainly done with list = []

Redo of W2 notes
 1. Always remember to put : otherwise will result in syntax error
 2. == basically means is 
 3. spacing is crucial
 4. int is required to do number_of_items
